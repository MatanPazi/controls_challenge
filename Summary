State vector shall be v - lateral velocity and r - yaw rate.

There's a constant delay of 4 samples in the steering command.
This was done by generating a relevant .csv file (Constant speed, 0 acceleration, 0 steering, 0 roll), implementing a test.py controller which generates a step command and seeing how many samples it takes for a noticeable change in values, both on the rising edge and the falling edge.

The run was done using:
python tinyphysics.py --model_path ./models/tinyphysics.onnx --data_path ./data/00000.csv --debug --controller pid

With an edited test.csv used and a test controller used.


Next, I wanted to know what kind of noise I had, so I updated the tinyphysics.py script to find the mean, STD deviation, and distribution quantities (Shapiro-wilk, Dagostino's K^2 p-value, Skewness & Excess Kurtosis.
Also plotted a histogram, and a Q-Q plot.
This was done for a single speed, need to expand to speed bins.
The conclusion was that the distribution was close to but not very normal/Gaussian.
The conclusion was to use an LQG controller with a regular Kalman filter and see how well it fared.
If the performance isn't adequate, consider using a robust Kalman filter (E.g Huber loss)






Next, I'd like to somehow model the noise in the system to add it to the system model.
Do I even need to model the noise? Will it help the control later on?








Next, I'd like to identify the parameters which might affect the system dynamics (matrices A and B). The parameters of interest are v_ego and a_ego (Statistical Sensitivity Tests).
v_ego definitely affect them, but I'd like to see how much a_ego affects the dynamics compared to v_ego.

This isn't strictly necessary as I assume I will include it as a scheduling parameter, but I'm interested in this process.
